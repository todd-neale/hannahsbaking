        My name is Hannah, and Iâ€™m a plant based recipe developer and food photographer. I fell in love with being in the kitchen nearly 2 years ago, when I adapted my lifestyle to being plant based. My hobby has turned into my career, and I now spend every day creating delicious vegan recipes both sweet and savoury, for all to enjoy. The aim of WhatLuceEats is to show that following a plant based diet is not flavourless, but in fact, full of deliciousness and variety.
